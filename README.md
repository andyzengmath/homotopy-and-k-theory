# homotopy-and-k-theory
homotopy theory and k theory seminar (Fall 2018)
Together with Thomas and Jingye, I am running the **Homotopy theory and K-theory learning seminar**. Our plan is to start from [Lecture notes on K-theory](http://folk.uio.no/rognes/kurs/mat9570v10/akt.pdf) and [Categorical homotopy theory](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/cathtpy.pdf), we hope to get a solid understanding higher algebraic K-theory and categorical homotopy theory by the end of this semester, and probably learn some higher categories theory.

**Meeting time** Each *Wednesday* 3:00pm at **4N49** and *Friday* 1:30pm at **4C6**
